Define a function remove_factor that takes two integer arguments,
x and p. x should be a non-zero positive integer and p should be a positive integer bigger than 1. 
The function should return how many times p is a factor of x.
For example if x=40 and p=2,
then you should return 3 since 40 = 2^3 Ã— 5 (i.e. 2 occurs as a factor of 40 three times)
